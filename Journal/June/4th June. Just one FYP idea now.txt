I discuss my idea with many teachers today.

First, we went to sir Basit Jasani. He told me to read 10-15 research paper and be more specific...more accurate about what I want to make.
Then the same feedback was given by sir Farrukh. 

As I said, People want assurance. They want confidence out of you.
In order to be confident, you need more brainstorming sessions. You need a more clear way of thinking about things... a more structured design of what you are going to make.

On a different note, this applies to learning as well. Thinking of yourself as a product.
You need a clear vision of what needs to be done. thats it. that plan doesn't need to be the best plan. it needs to be do-able and clear.

I changed my setup today. Shifted the monitor to right hand side and my books on the left hand.

Completed the MERN book tutorial.

I saw a video in which a guy saying that people dont usually look at the concept. 
That was a very powerful video... it helped me gain a better perspective on how to complete this video tutorial.
I learned that focusing on the concept is very important.
Knowing what youre learning. Dont just copy and paste the code. Understand what its doing is more important.

I am really grateful to Allah for making me see that video on the right time.
