Today is Eid - a day which is meant to be celebrated in the community. In the masjid, I realized and pondered upon how important it is to have strong ties with the community around you... to be happy. To be connected with them, be like a family.

Isolated life... although peaceful... leads to nowhere. 

Isolation. Mixing up. A good Balance between the both.
