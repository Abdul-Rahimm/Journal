to drive a car, we need some conditions. the car should have fuel, should have a working engine etc.

for any kind of movement, we need a force. no movement can be done without a source force. 
similarly, for any object to oscillate, we need some kind of resultant force. that rf acts towards the equilibrium position.

acc is proportional to the displacement from equilibrium 
acc should always act towards equilibrium  

rf can also be called restorative force.. and this is very meaningful name.

give the example of pendulum and ball.
when this spring is going to oscillate, there is going to be change of tension in the spring. that change in tension provides the restorative force.
