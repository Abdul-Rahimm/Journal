Alhamdullilah a quite productive day comes to an end. Grateful to Allah for giving me the opportunity to fill the day with learning.

Although the CN exam did not go well... it must be surely SURELY a blessing in disguise.

I am realizing how important it is to prep for important things so that you dont regret on the final performance day.
This lesson had to be learned. An important step in the way of discipline.
