Since the internet isnt letting me watch day in the life of a software engineer at LinkedIn peacefully, here i am documenting the day.

What I am realizing at this point is that the main things should always be at the top. 
And this is true in many scenerios. I realized it while looking at the previous journal entry actually. 
The main lessons should always be at the top. 
Have one look at them to refresh your memory of them.

Today, we went to Moin Bhai's place and I met Areeb bhai. It was a delightful outing experience, something other than the usual routine. Something different always is good. He talked about the ith and jth index, which his teachers had 500+ and, which i will explore.

He learned from professors who were the inventors of languages. But he didnt name any of those professors. weird.

things like these are worth documenting. they let you think about what happened in depth.

Thing about meeting with educated people is that you are going to see a lot of different perspectives. 
the good thing is that there is a lot of learning in comparing those perspectives and extracting the rich info out of them.

Valueable lesson: People might be good at one thing. but definitely lack the other.
