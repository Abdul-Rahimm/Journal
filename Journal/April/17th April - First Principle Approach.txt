I also learned about BALANCE today. and what does this word really mean?
think about it from a perspective of work play balance
of the balance between how their is good and evil in the world
the beautiful balance of the creation of this universe.
a concept.. a word worth exploring


What really is meant by the first principles approach? what does it really mean in the context of learning and cognition.
Maybe, what it means is that boil everything you learn down to the most simplest version. 
break the complex problem down into parts such as every part in itself is easy to accomplish.
deal with the parts one by one and the complex problem solves itself.

practially speaking about this theory:
for instance, if i want to become a good software engineer... i need to be good at DSA and development.
thats a really big task

now think about how to break this big task down into simpler chunks
for example the daily POTD serves as a task for enhancing your DSA skills
the daily youtube MERN stack video serves as a oppurunitu for u to learn web dev
the ML series lets you think about the creative side of CS and how thru CS u can do a variety of things.. it also 
makes you want to explore many things. 

so on and so forth. this is the basic idea. 

and this does not just restrict itself to your goals. 
you can apply this technique to learning as well. 

for instance, simplify what youre learning in ML right now:
Today you learned how to classify the images of humans vs horses. how the model works on feature extraction.
if you think about it... it was a step by step process. a proper iterative process

at first they created the directories of the training and validation set
then they moved on to creating the model
then they compiled the model and fit it with the training dataset
model.summary()
then they see how it works on the validation set

see... taking a bigger problem and breaking it down to smaller..more understandble peices.
