29th April - met Dr Nadir at Moin Bhai's place

Had an extremely insightful listening experience. He said that you can grasp everything there is to know about medical in 6 months.

What makes you think 6 months of dedicated training cant make you a good software engineer.

What matters is how early you sow the seeds.
