Today we will learn about Seerah - how the Prophet PBUH used to spend his time. 
- His behaviour as a human - is our possible way to understand his azmat.

Previously, during taleem sessions, I have learned quite a few Sunnahs of the Prophet PBUH such as 
1. stepping into the washroom with the left foot and exiting with the right.
2. investing time Dhikr
3. 33 33 33 after every namaz.

I am currently trying to establish the first one.

Khaas rehmat on the Ummah of Prophet PBUH. 

Quraan ki perwi. What does perwi mean and how to accomplish it?

Imaan bil lisaan - does not affect the character of a person.
Imaan which is rooted in the heart is the second and more important level.

Do I really think that Quraan is the book of God?
The answer is not that simple. If I say that a particular book is written by the smartest person in the world; someone who has the most IQ; or probably someone who is the most accopmplished in your field. And I say tha t he shares his secrets in that book. 
You would make sure that you read that book and UNDERSTAND it. 
Then why dont we invest time in learning, understanding the Quraan so that we may live our life according to it. Given that Quraan is the book which is written by creater of the earth and the seven heavens. 

Every blessing is a blessing iff it comes with guidance. 

Prophet PBUH asked Hz Umar RA: Umar main tumhe kitna azeez hun.
HZ umar replied huzoor aap mujhay dunya k har shakhs se ziada azeed hainn.
Prophet asked Umar kia main tumhe apni jaan se bhi ziada azeez hun?
HZ UMER PAUSED AND PONDERED.
then said jee huzoor aap mujhay meri jaan se bhi ziada azeez hain.
This is the required level of Imaan.
