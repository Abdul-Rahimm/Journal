A lot of emphasis has been placed on the act of "pondering". But what is rarely mentioned is that "intent" with which you ponder. What goal do you have in mind when you set out to do something? Why exactly are you exploring the Quraan? What do you aim to get out of it? 

I observed that when I set out to make a system to learn and understand the Quraan, Allah made it simple for me in just a single instant. He created the system for me then and there. That is utilize the break between Asr and Maghrib to study the quraan. That time is perfect due to its length; not too long so that you can easily focus on one thing the whole time. 

From today, i will inshaAllah continue my efforts to understand Surah Yaseen which is aka the Heart of the Quraan. I will see the video not one time but multiple times inshaAllah in order to understand why this Surah has such a distinguished martaba in our Holy book.

--> Quraan is for the living. 

1. Study of biology for the sake of Allah (your body is ever evolving)
2. Learning about and adopting the Sunnahs of Prophet PBUH

Second last verse of the Surah, as explained by Dr Israr sb, talks about Aalam Amr vs Aalam khalq. The concept of time is only for the Khalq.

Intellect vs emotions. structure of personality. Khalil Jibran(Aql se roshni hasil kro lekin jazbe k tehet harkat kro) meaning direction is aql's resp...but action should be taken with emotion.
here the word of aaqil was explained as the rope which the arab baddu people used to tie on their heads. They used to tie one leg out of the four of a camel so that he may not run. Once the Prophet PBUH saw a man which did not tie the leg of his camel and said that he had tawakkul on Allah. Prophet adviced first he should tie his camel and then place his trust on Allah swt. 

The methodology of Tabligh is beautifully explained by Dr Israr sb as being emotionally appealing. The only limitation is that it may prove unappealing to intellectuals (who long for understanding)   

personal reflection : What would the Prophet PBUH do? ask yourself this question in every aspect.
