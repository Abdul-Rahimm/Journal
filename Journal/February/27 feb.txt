Precision = relevantly retreived/total retreived
recall    = relevantly retreived/total relevant

stemming 
huerietic based rule fast
generates unreadable tokens
too aggressive. precision less recall more

lemmatization
considers dict and context slow
generates readable lexeme
better precision but less recall

inverted index
less sparsity 
quick access

champion list = for each term t in the dict
		you have a list of r docs
		which have the highest tf of t

post processing means processing on the result set. it removes all the false positives

we need to compress the dictionary mainly so that less time is involved in processing a quert. compressed dict means less disks to search
less response time
main goal is to make the dict fit into the main memory.
