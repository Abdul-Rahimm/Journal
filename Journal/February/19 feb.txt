A science based system for Learning - trying to put into practice whatever I learn

1. Active Recall - Retrieval of Learned Knowledge
- Recalling what I learned in the first part of the video
- Recalling once helps you retain knowledge for the 9 months.
- Recalling many times - 8 years
- Highlighting and going thru the text again is not recommended.
- The harder it is to recall - the better that info is understood and retained.
- The above notes are not coherent. Their order is not conserved. Try jotting a story with whatever you learn. see if it helps retention.

2. Spaced repitition
- The story started with 12 questions of mathematics. 
- some students did all of the questions at once.
- the other group divided the questions for 3 days.
- the other group achieved a 2x better result!

- The longer you want to retain something... the Longer should be the space between the repitition.
- IF you want to retain something for 5 years... space it for 5-6 months.

3. Interleaving - mix and match
- my own analysis for this: When you switch things up... it gives you the oppurtunity to learn something new and link it with something you already know. so theres greater learning in that regard.
- studying different artists' works.

4. Questioning.

--> In the end, I believe the experimentation and the mistakes never really stop. And something which works for other people might or might not work for you. 

--> Whats important, therefore is that you keep and open mind and continue moving forward.
