In order to work optimally, you need the correct headspace. 

I define headspace as
headspace: your mental environment. 

Just like how you need your desk to be uncluttered and organized. So do you need the mental environment to be as well. The difference is that the physical environment is seen more easily. You can catch the thing which is out of balance more easily. But that is more subtle when it comes to the mental environment. 

I think that is why people invented writing. To get to that baseline level of mental clarity. Just put it down... all of it down. And see what you have written.

I know that I will figure it out in the end. I am 100% sure of it. 

The most important change I need to make is to prefer the low stimulation grind over the high stimulation relaxation.

3 most important things I learned from the video:
1. You will only respect yourself after the hard choices.
2. Bring your baseline dopamine level down. 
	More Journaling. More Walking. More uncomfortable boredom. More Learning when it does not 	feel like it.
3. Having the full 30 days - the bigger picture in mind.
