19th - July - Started a bit of SE and System Design

Netflix and Discord are big tech companies with very effective system designs. But they have their current design as a result of solving multiple problems as they arised. 

System Design comes with time, as hassan bhai told me earlier. It comes with experience.. you learn the little nuances of what to do and what not to do in a specific situation with time, as you face it.

Case studies is the recommended way. I will inshaAllah read case studies related to engineering and design. The purpose is not to memorize things but be familiar with what problems can arise and how to solve them.
