As cliche as it may sound... but the journey of a thousand lines does indeed start from a single word. 

I was just sitting and relaxing, watching Modern Family at 2:12am when it suddenly struck me. And as always, I am quick at converting the impulse to action. I dont know if its a good thing or bad, but in this scenario, it does me good.

Maybe I end up writing a book, maybe I dont. But if I try, there is going to be a lot of learning in the process. The process is what matters.
