Starting the new month with a very good news. Alhamdulillah Allah is the best of providers.

Ya Allah provide me with knowledge of benefit as well. Knowledge which will do me good in the long run.

My day started really well. I lead the debate activity today at OTF. It felt great to be in charge and I am learning quite a lot of things about myself.

Something really interesting was, how, when we were discoursing about junk food, no one (not even myself) thought about the out-of-box concept. Education is truly learning how to think. learning how to solve the problems at hand. 

This day had a very easy problem. 
I tried another problem - It had to be solved thru sliding window, still dont know what the logic is.. will test out tomorrow
