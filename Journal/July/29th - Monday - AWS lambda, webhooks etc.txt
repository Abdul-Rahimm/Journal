Just learned a little more about Kafka and how it is used because it has very high throughput

two other things which really matter areS
1. sequential IO instead of random	
2. zero copy principle

-- distribution and scaling of messaging systems

I am going to learn the things as I need them Insha'Allah. I am very grateful for being able to go to office today and have the most productive day which I had. There was so much to learn and so much I accomplished today Alhamdullilah.
