how can i best capture the impact that social network has had on me?

did it teach me any valueable life lesson?

1. scalability.
2. maximizing minimum brain power
3. you are going to face problems and setbacks. how do u get back up?

what did I experience the rut in the first place? 
. not taking breaks at the right time
. not having the right kinds of break - swimming pool


They did have the OS lab as well. that is not what separated them. the good marks did not separate them.
it was their ability to think. and act. upon their ideas. and those ideas were original. 
useful. had a strong connection to the people around. they were smart to know what the people wanted.

this is the exact thing which is being captured at a large level?
if u want to trap someone. show them something which they want the most.
