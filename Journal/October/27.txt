I am giving my best.
But I am not sure if i am improving.

lets think about this in this way.
if i wasnt putting this much effort. would i be on the same current level.
or would i be somewhere below. 

I think somewhere below definitely.

i think this is how the process of growth feels like. 

I think i need some modifications as well though. Give a little more time to each individual problem and try to understand it fully.
rather than trying more questions... i need to master the questions which i am unable to solve i think. 
learn as much as i can from each problem.
