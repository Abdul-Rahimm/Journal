I am learning about clean architecture on a daily basis
There is so much to learn. But I am sleepy right now. xD

there are 4 main things I need to keep in mind:
1. Frameworks
2. Interface adapters
3. usecases
4. business logic

the fifth thing is infrastructure, which seperates the DB stuff. 
so that when testing, you dont need a database connected.
