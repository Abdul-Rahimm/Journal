Today was a productive day alhamdulllah. 

I invested time in leetcode. Looked at several questions. 
At the end, I watched a video related to AWS services. 
The guy said that the best way to learn about AWS is
    when you learn the concepts and try to build something.

I also went to the gym today. It was uncomfortable. But I have got to continue it InshaAllah.

I realize that we become better at what we consistently do. 
I tried pullups today after a month. Still was able to do them.

I think consistency matters a lot. It might not mean much in the short term... but will prove useful in the end
