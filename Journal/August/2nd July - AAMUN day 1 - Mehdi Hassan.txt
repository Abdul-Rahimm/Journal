Mehdi says a very simple statement. yet its so profound. maybe its the way he speaks... i think its that. its the way he makes his point. 

he says that you need preparation. you need prep to become better. and i think i needed this reminder very bad. i was forgetting this along the way.

if i don't practice what i am good at. i am gonna lose it eventually.
