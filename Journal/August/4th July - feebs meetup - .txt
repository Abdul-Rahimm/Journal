I met with fabiha today, it was good talking with her after a long time. Its when you talk to people, you realize what you like and dislike. In this way, talking is a form of self discovery.

apart from that, this MUN has made me learn a lot of things. most importantly, it has led me to a direction, in which If i proceed, i learn. I have started listening to Mehdi Hasan speak.

Its going to take me a long time to learn and become better. Become a natural at winning debates. I start late and thats okay. Maybe its not late according to some standards. Since the vision is to improve... its never too late.
