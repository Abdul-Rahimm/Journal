26th March - Al-Hikmah - Ep13

We also need to understand the laws which are mentioned in the Quraan. What laws are mentioned?

Law and Wisdom(when should law be applied and when not in the strictest sense)

As parents, this should be taken the utmost care of. When to be sakht and when not to be. 

Law of Hijaab. after Uhud. Surah Ahzab. 
Timing of the Law. When you are ready...

Right time. Emphasis on right time. When does Allah reveal something. 

Human beings take time to mature and learn. 

Law - letter and spirit.
technicality and the effect.
timings for prayer/technique and the remembrance of Allah.
outside and inside. 

ISA AS - book,wisdom and torah,injeel(letter , spirit)
Balance between the letter and spirit. 

How to connect with Allah swt? Please ponder over this question. Spirit.SPIRIT.

Keep in check with all the laws. 

Al Malik. kingdom - symbols.
Al Quddoos holy pure
Al Aziz powerful authority 
Al Hakeem wise 

Sprituality is above the mind. 

Ibrahim AS
