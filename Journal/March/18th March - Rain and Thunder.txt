18th March - Rain and Thunder - imagery

Arabs were behind the world. Then Allah swt revealed the Quran as a light in Arabia... as light for the whole world.

Image: light being struck. illuminates. dark pathway being lighted up. light so that you can move. 

Alhamdullilah for this study session and the peace. 

Islam actually brings you towards the light. It opens your eyes to the real peace in the world. Allah Pak promises in the Quran and if you just ponder over those promises.. for example: Allah pak says we will provide Rizq to you. and that Allah provides Rizq to people according to his will. Just reflecting upon this promise... all your worldly anxieties will fade. 
But that does not mean you just blindly put your faith and sit down and do nothing. the battles were not won just by sitting and trusting Allah swt. Sahabah had to put their lives at risk first and then trusted Allah. 

Haram is guaranteed bad for you. its filth.
Halal is good for you confirm. 

Somebody makes a fire. and leads the way. Be the one who leads. 

light and darkness is about the believers as well. 
Quran is described as light. SubhanAllah. 

Allah pak says that the signs are clear. It means that if we ponder enough... we will be able to lead ourselves towards goodness easily. The Quran is not difficult to understand as some people say. it is loud and clear. straighforward. 

for the Beleiver, there is a constant struggle. between the darkness and the light. the darkness and the light. 
Khoobsurat baat is.. Allah keeps pulling you out. SubhanAllah.

O you who believe, be mindful(ehsaas) of Allah. he will give you double of his rehmah. 

Ustaadh is saying, correctly indeed, that in today's time, we dont really know what darkness is. Allah pak will put in place a light for us. so that we can use that light to help us walk (on the straight path)

travelling lets you experience. desert.

imagery switches. us following Allah's guidance. led by Prophet PBUH

Ya Allah complete our light for us. the light which we need to walk towards Jannah.
Ya Allah give us the light in this world as well as the better world.
