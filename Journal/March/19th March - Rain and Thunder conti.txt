19th March - Rain and Thunder continuation

Allah wanted me to listen to this for the second time. SubhanAllah.
1. TOP BAAT: 
Is the wind, rain, sunlight etc mercy from Allah? YES
but the wind uprooted AAD's people.
the same blessing becomes the source of destruction for you. if you are not grateful.

layers of darkness(disturbance, agitation) - for the disbelievers. 

the words of Quran are the most meaningful. every word has a context and a meaning. Quraan itself is an invitation to deep thinking. SubhanAllah

Allah knows things.. which you do not know. Do not speculate.
