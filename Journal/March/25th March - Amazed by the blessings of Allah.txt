25th March - Amazed by the blessings of Allah swt.

Ya ALLAH ya arham ar rahimeen. Please grant me true wisdom. The wisdom to understand your deen and become close 

Allah paak cares more than anybody possibly can. The proof of this according to my little experience and knowledge is how he always makes me come back to the masjid. Even after comitting sins back and back again.. how he always makes me and enables me to ask for forgiveness again and again SubhanAllah.

Allah pak cares more than anybody else possibly can. Whatever happens to me happens from Allah swt. It doesnt make me anxious. It just makes me more and more grateful to my Allah because I know that it is for the betterment of me.
