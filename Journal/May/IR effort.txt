Relevance Feedback Bank

qs - what is meant by query expansion?
- autonomous process of reformulating a seed query.
- to improve retrieval performance.
- bridges the gap between what the user actually wants and what query is he coming up with
- lexical mismatch such as car and automobile.

Text classification Bank

qs - why is naive bayes regarded as a baseline classifier
- probabilistic classifier based on applying bayes theorem
- strong independence assumption bw the features. we assume that there is no dependence bw the features in naive bayes
- highly scalable
- offers a standard classification
- improvement can be done by relaxing the assumptions

qs- how do we treat the words that do no appear in the training doc for NB classifiers?
- in NB classifier, training data is never complete
- there are always terms(features) that do not appear in training data
- the max likelihood for such terms is zero - we can not compute probability for a given class
- one solution is laplace smoothing - simply add one to all counts

Text clustering Bank

qs - differentiate between K means and HAC approaches to clustering
1. k means is a partition clustering approach while HAC is a hierarchical clustering approach(produces hierarchy of clusters)
2. it takes k as input number of clusters to be produced. HAC merges clusters to produce hierarchy, you can cut at the desired level.
3. running time depends upon data points. time is polynomial

- K means converges to a local min. in order to find optimal clustering, one needs to find out all the possible cluster arrangments.

Web search and crawler bank

qs - difference between directory style search(yahoo) and text search(google)
- directory search maintains a large hierarchical directory of terms
- user needs to follow topic based hierarchical path to get his required info
- difficult
- exploration of the hierarchical path gives you the relevant results

on the other hand, text search is quite easy
- simple text based search
- autonomously crawl and index pages based on text terms.
- relevant results are based on retrieval approach (PageRank) rather than hierarchy.

qs - three different types of user queries

qs - three challenges of a modern web crawler and solution
1. websites usually block access when you are trying to access them using an autonomous crawler. the crawler must be polite and respect
the implicit and explicit policies regarding the rate at which the crawler can visit them.
2. crawler must be robust and extensible (adapt to new formats etc)s
3. crawler must be distributed and scalable as it needs to crawl millions of web pages.
4. freshness - must maintain a newest copy of previously fetched pages.

Link analysis Bank

qs. four differences between HITS and PageRank algorithms 
1. HITS gives two scores for each page ie hub and authority. pagerank always gies just a single score
2. hits is not robust. pagerank is robust.
3. hits is computed at runtime. pagerank is pre computed at index time.
4. hits never favours pages. pagerank favours old pages.
5. hits is query dependent.


HITS and PageRank algorithms need to be done

qs - interesting facts about HITS algorithm
1. the documents that emerge as the top hubs and authorities often contain language other
then the lang of the query. this confirms cross lang IR
2. HITS is more stable for link analysis. a small change in the link topology does not 
majorly alter the result set


HOW DOES HITS WORK
h1 = p.a0 		--> hubs1 = adj  *auth0
a1 = pTranspose.h0 	--> auth1 = adjT *hub0
