I am a firm believer in the fact that everything which you set out to do
can be accomplished when you give it your 110%.
The extra 10% is actually the cost. 
The cost you have to pay when you invest time in doing that thing, lets say X, and not any other thing, lets say Y or Z.
If you observe, everything great comes with a sacrifice. Sometimes, its your money, other times, its your time.
