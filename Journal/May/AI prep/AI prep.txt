Lets start with Bayesian Networks. 

Covered the slides of Bayesian networks
Completed video number 1 to get fundamental understanding of concepts.

Tomorrow first thing is to write the first 2 examples on paper and understand them.
then move on to second video on Bayesian networks

------
I have covered 4 examples of Bayesian networks in depth. 
Now will move onto other topics

Will cover the concept videos first.
follow the plan made. 
--------
most of the topics are covered on an introductory level...now what needs to be done is examples.

at the end of the day we will have super review. brief. 
for that... its important to have good notes. 

... we will resume with linear regression after lunch. 
followed by performance matrix - still needs to be revisited
followed by nueral networks.. know what is meant by feed forwarding. 
--------
we will resume studying at 11 - with nueral network 20 min video and then Neeraj slide.

I have also downloaded some past papers... do have a look at them.


all this will be followed by worked examples of Bayesian network and then KNN/kmeans
---------------

the official prep is done. alhamdullilah.

will have a summary look tomorrow in point.
