A new day... same goals... new learning.

Lets start with Namaz.

Read CN book as part of yesterday's content review
did breakfast and then watched the web and http part 2

spend an hour+ time on leetcode DFS question. figured the logic achi tarh se by looking at the tutorial
the correction actually filled a gap in my fundamental knowledge.

now i am relaxing
the plan for future is to cover 2-3 more CN videos today inshaAllah while making notes.

invested 2 hours in tuition and then pushed myself to go to gym. this was a very good decision.
the discipline that made me reach the gym...everything else happened automatically.

I did abs like they should be done. I clearly realize how i am able to progressively overload. my form is also getting better.

then i read my book for 10-15 mins with full focus. followed by Email video of CN and some question on chatGPT.
