Had my IR final exam today. It went really well AH, thanks to God. 
Something which proved to be really beneficial was the past paper practice. 

I intend to follow the same course of routine for the other papers as well inshaAllah.

Thing is that IR past papers were pretty well managed. 
I developed a good question Bank.

AI past papers are messed up I think... so will have to manage somehow. 
I have got the book as well with me.. but keep in mind that I just have tomorrow and day after tomorrow before tbw and then the weekend
for AI.

will follow the same morning routine. 
get up and start the day by reading some book. 

then start studying AI inshaAllah.
