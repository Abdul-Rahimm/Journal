I learned a lot today while reading Goggin's book.

How he always owns his decisions. How he did not blame his pacer for the route mistake and realized it was his own mistake.
I learned how important it is to stay locked in. And keep grinding. Becoming better.

There is no ONE right answer.

You make an app. You make it for one person. 
How to make it in a way that scaling it is easier.
