I have realized that I currently have a lot of things which I am focusing on.

I am postponing this to when the contests are near.
1. Leetcode / codeforces (in my university time, I dedicate large portion of my time here)
-> This could, right now be divided into parts:
a) Leetcode contest by Abhinash
b) Codeforces div 4 by Neal Wu

Increased focus needs to be invested here to pick up speed.
2. Web Development - Frontend (large part of my job time is invested here)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some things which I need to do:

- Start learning JS concepts for interviews (not urgent)
- Start React-Native Project. AOra. One of the high priority.
- Resume Coding with Dawid project - Speed and understanding of code > 
    --> prioritize going thru and learning for now over writing the code yourself.

- Mazeed strengthen frontend concepts like flex-box and grid. (I think this will get automatically covered in coding with Dawid so that is high priority)
- Mazeed work on how pages are designed.
-> Today, I watched and implemented the three-tier pricing plan. Learned a good system for coding.

- AWS services.
- Exploring Drupal in Office.
