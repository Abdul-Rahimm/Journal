Starting the Cloud Journey with Discipline.

Day 01
-- Cloud practitioner course is knowledge based. 

-- Elastic Beanstalk --> directly use a pre-configured server for deployment of your app
qs: an software company needs to deploy their app(ruby) but they dont want to know the config and technical details. what should they use.
without needing to fully know and understand the underlying infra

qs) an accounting firm needs to save customer data. for 7 years. which storage service should they use
-- now for this u need to understand k which service serves exactly what usecases. characterstics of each storage service

Day 01 went pretty well Ah.
